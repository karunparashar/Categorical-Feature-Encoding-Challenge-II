# Categorical-Feature-Encoding-Challenge-II
This dataset contains around 20 features and has mixed features- including numerical, categorical and ordinal.
This contains around a million records including both test and train data.
Tasks performed include-
•	Analyzed and identified missing records among features
•	Type of data in different features
•	Dropping features which seemed redundant on the basis of the enormous number of levels those features contained
•	Performed Recursive feature elimination to remove features with very high interaction with others
•	Also used Backward selection to exhaustively remove insignificant elements
Models created and tested
•	K-Nearest Neighbors
•	Random Forest
•	Gradient Boosting
•	Support Vector with radial kernel
